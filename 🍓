before Hurricane Frances hit in 2004,
Walmart performed a statistical analysis of product sales before a natural disaster
of the millions of items moving the WMT ticker up and down
the one item that shot past all others before a hurricane:
strawberry pop tarts. 
it's a bit comically symbolic
in times of utter destruction and desolation
the american people turn to little silver-wrapped packets of artificially-sweetened-goo-stuffed-carbohydrates
it's the backbone of democracy
a true, non-partisan american hero.
